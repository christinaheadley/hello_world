1. Paste a link to your github repository below:

https://github.com/christinaheadley/hello_world.git

2. What questions do you have about what we've learned so far using git and github?:

Does cloning work on folders only? Why did I end up with two README files (but just one folder) for hello_world? 
Why is it --all instead of -all?
